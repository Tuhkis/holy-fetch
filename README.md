# Holy-fetch
The fech program of God.

# Building
For compiling you need the [hc2c transpiler](https://github.com/IridescentRose/HolyC-Translator), gcc and make.
Then run:
```
make
```
(You might have to create the `bin` folder) <br>
and move the binary `/usr/bin/`

# Contributing
Other distro art would be nice (I beg you (It's in `src/logo.h`))
